Make your excuses
Who cares if they see right through
Now it's time for just me and you
Find a way to leave them there, meet me here
Where we can find a way to carry on

Where we left off babe
Where we left off

Meet me here at the end of the coastal path
By the pub where you opened my eyes
Once more as we touched and we shared and laughed
I counted my lucky starts

All the while it grew dark babe
All the while it grew dark

Gentle waves scatter the stars babe
This night is here for the taking

Here's my heart babe
Here's my heart

Meet me here at the end of the coastal path
We'll walk on the beach till it's dark
There we'll stop and I'll give you my heart
And you'll know, you'll know what to do with it

Here's my heart babe
Here's my heart
