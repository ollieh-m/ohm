She held on tight
But her body gave in
She was only a few years
Older than him
But even the little things
No, especially those

Little things
Cut throught the fog
Open your eyes
Make you stop
Yeah it's the little things, like
Who will go first
When we get our dog

The smallest things
Make you think
That picture
Feels like a dream
Will that be the best
It'll ever be
Will we ever get another day
Anything like it

Get the feeling
More and more
The feeling that
Time is short
Each time it's shorter than before

When it's getting dark outside
Sometimes I find
I feel we got away with that one
Counting down
In hopeful crowds

Think about the time
When the chance has gone
To say the things
As I wish I'd done
Will lose the chance
To say to him
All of the things
I wish I did

Like how I'm proud
To be his son
That he's never held back
By anyone
Pushes himself
Pushes on
To look back and be proud
Of what he's done

But when he feels
That he's fallen short
Or when he's unsure
What he's aiming for
I understand
It must hit him hard
Wish I'd said I know
That it tears him apart

Cos he pushes himself
Pushes on
To be who he won't become
I'll wish I'd said I know what he numbs

When it's getting dark outside
Sometimes I find
I feel we got away with that one
Counting down
In hopeful crowds
At least we got away with another one

As the time
Slips away
Lose the chance
Chance to pay
Pay him back
In any way
For all that he gave
Day after day

But I start to see
Comes to view
A time soon
When I cannot choose
But to do what I can
To pay the debt
As well as I can
When I can do nothing else

When the tables turn
And he turns to me
Thought hits home
That even he
Will hang on tight
But start to fade
Time runs out
It is slipping away

And in the end
Even if there was time
To pay back and say it all
I'll feel we had our time cut short

When it's getting dark outside
Sometimes I find
I feel we got away with that one
Counting down
In hopeful crowds
At least we got away with another one
