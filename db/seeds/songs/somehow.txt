We are lost
We are lost
We lost ourselves
Cut us off
Cut us off
Cut ourselves off
From out ties
From our jobs
From the lives we lived

We are free
We are free
We are free to fall
We will fall
We will fall
We will fall in love
Again
When I catch you and you catch me too

Now's our chance to find our place
To burn a flame that shows the way
Let's grab it
Let's run away

We're free now
We're free now
We'll make it work out
Somehow
Somehow

It was worse
It was worse
Don't lose our nerve
We are bored
We are bored
And scared to start
But before
The before nearly tore us apart
We are scared
We are scared
We were scared before
So we ran
So we ran
And here we are
With a chance
With a chance
To change it all

Now's our chance to find our place
To burn a flame that shows the way
Let's grab it
Let's run away

We're free now
We're free now
We'll make it work out
Somehow
Somehow
