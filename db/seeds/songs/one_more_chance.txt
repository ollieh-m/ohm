One more chance
Always seems to be another chance
One more chance
Always seems to be another last
Bite my tongue
Don't feel the need to bite my tongue
Don't bite my tongue
Don't feel like letting go
Of this one

But the fear each time gets worse
The seconds before we work it out and laugh it off
Get longer, harder
So I swear
This time it'll be the last

Comfortable
A little too comfortable
Comfortable
A little too safe and stable
Eyes on me
I'm always there, your eyes on me
Eyes on me
No wonder you get bored, start dreaming

But there's something there we know
The tingling thread that keeps us safe, so comfortable
So we do what it takes, wait however long
For the fizz inside, the heat in Paris in the snow

So on form
That smile is mine
Your so on form
Floating out of time
So on form
That smile is mine
You close your eyes, can you see me?

That smile, that dance, that time
That smile, that dance, that time
That smile, that dance, that time
When you reached out
Pulled me in your arms
Whispered let's fly

Let's fly
