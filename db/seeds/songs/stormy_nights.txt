Such things
To realise I need you
Such little things
Things that it takes
To make the world feel big again

Such things
Remind me of days when
When I couldn't cope
Cope on my own
Collapse into myself again

Stormy nights
Losing time
Running round in circles
Trying to find
Find you here
But still too far
In that bar full of strangers getting high
I realise
I need you more
More than I really thought
Beneath the love
Beneath the warmth
Fear of losing it all

Such things
To realise I need you
Sound of the wind
Wind and the rain
Running trying to find you
Such things
Don't know where I am now
Said you were near
Won't answer your phone
The night has me swallowed whole

Stormy nights
Losing time
Running round in circles
Trying to find
Find you here
But still too far
In that bar full of strangers getting high
I realise
I need you more
More than I really thought
Beneath the love
Beneath the warmth
Fear of losing it all
