Crash to the floor
There you lay
Sting doesn't last
Sharpness fades

But it feels worse when the sting fades
Yeah it feels worse when the sting fades
Lonely ache
The lonely wait
Until you can count the days

Then every day
She's closer to you
Yeah every day
The lonely ache fades
Until the day
You're counting the hours
Until day
You're counting the miles

She'll be there in your arms tonight
She'll be there in your arms

But that doesn't last
Sharpness returns
Gone from your arms
Tears start to burn
Crash to the floor
There you lay
Sting doesn't last
Sharpness fades

But it feels worse when the sting fades
Yeah it feels worse when the sting fades
Lonely ache
The lonely wait
Until you can count the days

Then every day
She's closer to you
Yeah every day
The lonely ache fades
Until the day
You're counting the hours
Until day
You're counting the miles

She'll be there in your arms tonight
She'll be there in your arms
